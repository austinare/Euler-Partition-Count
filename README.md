# Euler-Partition-Count
A function that counts how many times a number can be broken into whole integers.

Example: 5 can be broken into the following partitions
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
1 + 2 + 2 = 5
1 + 1 + 3 = 5
1 + 4 = 5
5

for a total of 5 partitions (it is a formality to count the solo number as a partition).

The mathematics are described in [this mathologer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ8pnCO0nTY&ab_channel=Mathologer).
